## Core Themes

### 1. AI Governance & Policy Systems

Development of artificial intelligence-supported decision frameworks for public administration, evidence-based policy formation, and leadership reinforcement models.

### 2. Digital Sovereignty & Citizen Data Architecture

Design of secure, citizen-first data vault models that balance privacy, transparency, and public service delivery.

### 3. Civilisational State Framework

Integration of Dharma as ethical governance logic within modern constitutional democracy.  
This is a civilisational policy framework, not theological advocacy.

### 4. Public Scheme Literacy Infrastructure

Development of structured, accessible platforms that reduce informational asymmetry between citizens and government programs.
